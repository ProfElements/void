# void
A game framework aimed to be `no_std`.
Void has the philosophy that you implement the backend, we provide the rest.

This project of a larger effort of mine called `workspace` to implement rust gamedev on consoles I play and want to develop for.

## Modules
Currently has only one WIP module `void-gfx`. 
`void-gfx` currently implements basic primitives with batching support in the future.

## Examples
Currently has one example `wii`. 
`wii` is what most of what `void` will be dogfooded into for the foreseeable future.
